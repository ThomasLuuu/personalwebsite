### Installing

This assignment has been included some dictionaries inside. You don't need to install anything. This project works good in FireFox Browser. (DON'T USE SAFARI)


### What I have done:
In this project I have done everything that were taught in class. First, I use boostrap 4 to create row, column, card, and carousel, this method is good for newbie to create the web easier.

JAVASCRIPT:

Then, I use some Javascript code to create functions, which make my website pages look more pretty and be useful with user.
First, I used Javascript to create a function to scroll down the page with a click from user. Secondly, I created a function called "GoBrowser()" that will save the user time to find the fastest way to my company, user just need to
INPUT ADDRESS, CHOOSE VEHICLE, AND CLICK THE BUTTON. My function will search the fastest to my location and show it to user via Google Map.

JQUERY:

I used Jquery to create the form, and check if user input infomation inside the form correctly. 
For example: if email not included "@" it means the infomation is invalid, user has to include "@" inside their email. After filling correctly the form, there is a box to re-confirm the user's submition. If user click yes, the form will be submitted.





## Running the tests
